## Project Description
While humans effortlessly recognize handwritten digits like the one depicted above, computers find this task challenging. This is where deep learning, inspired by the functioning of the human brain, comes into play.

Deep learning involves the construction of neural networks comprising layers of interconnected "neurons." These networks learn from vast amounts of data using complex algorithms, mimicking the human brain's learning process.

Our project focuses on implementing a deep learning algorithm using PyTorch to recognize handwritten digits. The MNIST dataset, consisting of 70,000 handwritten digits divided into training and test sets, serves as the basis for our model development.
